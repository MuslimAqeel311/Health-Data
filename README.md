# Health-Data
This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of a healthcare dataset. The primary goal is to derive actionable insights from the data and explore predictive modeling

### Data Loading

The healthcare dataset is imported and cleaned for further analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In-depth analysis of the healthcare data to understand patient demographics, medical conditions, medication usage, and other relevant metrics.
### Data Visualization

Various visualizations are created to identify trends and patterns in the healthcare data, including:
Distribution of medical conditions.
Medication usage across different conditions.
Patient demographics and their impact on health outcomes.
### Insights

Actionable insights are derived from the data analysis to improve healthcare outcomes, such as identifying high-risk groups or optimizing medication prescriptions.
### Predictive Modelling
Application of machine learning models to predict patient outcomes and optimize healthcare strategies.
